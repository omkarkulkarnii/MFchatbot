## About Section/Project Goals/Project opportunities:
 First of all, I thank team FRT and Microsoft for you collaborative help towards students in understanding more than basics of Cloud Computing. 
 I am really honored to share my project with everyone.
  This bot helps you trade, invest and grow your money on Indian Stock Market by providing questions to your answers in a easy way. I have used different sources for this project by even creating a excel file with custom questions and answers. Till date I have achieved to make answer the bot certain types of questions related to stock market like "What is Stock Market" "What are Shares" "How to buy and sell shares" etc and also about mutual funds like ( What is the fund size of ... ) ( What is the age of xyz mf ) ( What is the expense ration of...). Apart from mutual funds for additional information I have also connected adigitalblogger's website to the sources and generated more questions and answers for information on How to trade , Charges on Groww , how to buy a stock , and many more. This UI is connected to a google site page for better accessibility.
