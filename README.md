## About Section/Project Goals/Project opportunities:
  This bot helps you trade, invest and grow your money on Indian Stock Market by providing questions to your answers in a easy way. I have used different sources for this project by even creating a excel file with custom questions and answers. Till date I have achieved to make answer the bot certain types of questions about mutual funds like ( What is the fund size of ... ) ( What is the age of xyz mf ) ( What is the expense ration of...). Apart from mutual funds for additional information I have also connected adigitalblogger's website to the sources and generated more questions and answers for information on How to trade , Charges on Groww , how to buy a stock , and many more. This UI is connected to a google site page for better accessibility. Soon, I am planning to deploy it on Azure Web Services and update the bot with more training models.
